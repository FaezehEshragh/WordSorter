# Word Sorter

## Problem:
<p>Write a small piece of Java code that takes a list of words and sorts it by value (A=1, Z=26)
in standard OOP and again using functional programming. Please include the code, the input list, and output of your code.</p>



# Assumptions:

1. **Word Value Calculation:**
    - The numeric value of a word is determined by summing the values of its letters.
    - The value of letters is assigned as follows: `A = 1` and `Z = 26`.

2. **Case Insensitivity:**
    - Lowercase and uppercase letters are considered to have the same value. For instance, 'a' and 'A' are equivalent.

3. **Input Constraints:**
    - The inputs are assumed to consist of normal words, containing only letters and excluding other UTF-8 characters.

4. **Java Built-in Functionality:**
    - Utilizing Java's built-in functionality is assumed to be permissible for the solution.
